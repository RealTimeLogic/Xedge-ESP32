# Barracuda Application Server for ESP32

Turn your ESP32 into an advanced Edge Controller and/or IoT Gateway
with the Barracuda Application Server. The included Xedge turns the
Barracuda Application Server library into an awesome development tool,
thus enabling virtually anyone to program the ESP32 using the super
easy to learn Lua Scripting language. Lua is a beginner-friendly
coding language and is in fact promoted as a first programming
language for children.
