# Barracuda Application Server for ESP32

Turn your ESP32 into an advanced Edge Controller and/or IoT Gateway
with the Barracuda Application Server. The included LSP Application
Manager turns the Barracuda Application Server library into an awesome
development tool, thus enabling virtually anyone to program the ESP32
using the super easy to learn Lua Scripting language. Lua is a
beginner-friendly coding language and is in fact promoted as a first
programming language for children.
