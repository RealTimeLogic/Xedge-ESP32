Xedge32 Components and Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keep in mind that this document exclusively covers Xedge32-specific features. Xedge32 is composed of three software components:

1. **Barracuda App Server**: The cornerstone of Xedge32, this advanced IoT toolkit constitutes 90% of its functionality. Serving as a foundational tool for embedded systems and IoT applications, it provides web server capabilities, data encryption, and multi-protocol support, making it the backbone for secure and scalable IoT projects.

  - `IoT Protocols <https://realtimelogic.com/ba/doc/?url=IoT.html>`_
  - `Product page <https://realtimelogic.com/products/barracuda-application-server/>`_

2. **Xedge**: A generic, Lua-based development platform (REPL) that facilitates rapid prototyping without the need for frequent compile and deploy cycles and is applicable beyond just ESP32.
